A **doubly cyclic linked list** is a type of linked list where:
1. Each node has two pointers:
   - `next`: Points to the next node.
   - `prev`: Points to the previous node.
2. The `next` pointer of the last node points back to the first node (head).
3. The `prev` pointer of the first node (head) points back to the last node (tail), forming a circular structure in both directions.
