A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains pointers to both its previous and next nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

Structure of a Node:
1. Data: The value stored in the node.
2. Previous Pointer: Points to the previous node in the list.
3. Next Pointer: Points to the next node in the list.
