Singly Linked List:

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node in the sequence. Each node contains two components:
1. Data: The value stored in the node.
2. Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list.


Key Characteristics:
1. The list starts with a "head" pointer pointing to the first node.
2. The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.
3. Each node is dynamically allocated, allowing for efficient memory use.
4. It supports dynamic resizing, unlike arrays.
