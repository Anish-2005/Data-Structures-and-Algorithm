Singly Linked List:

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node in the sequence. Each node contains two components:
1. Data: The value stored in the node.
2. Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list.


Key Characteristics:
1. The list starts with a "head" pointer pointing to the first node.
2. The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.
3. Each node is dynamically allocated, allowing for efficient memory use.
4. It supports dynamic resizing, unlike arrays.


Operations and Their Complexities:

-------------------------------------------------
| Operation             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
-------------------------------------------------
| Traversal             | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Search (unsorted)     | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Insert at Beginning   | O(1)           | O(1)             |
| Insert at End         | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Insert at a Position  | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Delete from Beginning | O(1)           | O(1)             |
| Delete from End       | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Delete by Value       | O(n)           | O(1)             |

Key Advantages:
1. Efficient insertion and deletion compared to arrays (no need for shifting elements).
2. Dynamic resizing allows for better memory utilization.
3. Suitable for applications where frequent insertions and deletions occur.

Key Disadvantages:
1. Cannot perform random access; traversal is required to access elements.
2. Extra memory is required for pointers.
3. Operations like searching are slower compared to arrays.

Applications:
1. Dynamic memory allocation systems.
2. Implementing stacks and queues.
3. Polynomial arithmetic (to store terms of polynomials).
4. Managing symbolic expressions in compilers and interpreters.
