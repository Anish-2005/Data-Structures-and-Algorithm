A **cyclic linked list** is a variation of a linked list where the last node in the list points back to one of the previous nodes, forming a loop. This can be implemented as a singly or doubly linked list. 

In a singly cyclic linked list:
- Each node has a single pointer (`next`) that points to the next node.
- The `next` pointer of the last node points back to the first node (head).

In a doubly cyclic linked list:
- Each node has two pointers: `next` (points to the next node) and `prev` (points to the previous node).
- The `prev` pointer of the head points to the last node, and the `next` pointer of the last node points to the head.

### Key Characteristics:
1. The list forms a circular structure with no null pointers.
2. Traversal can continue indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.
3. Suitable for applications requiring repeated traversal, such as buffers and gaming.

### Advantages:
1. Efficient circular traversal is possible.
2. Avoids null checks while traversing the list.

### Disadvantages:
1. Requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops during traversal.
2. Cycle detection adds extra complexity.

### Applications:
1. Implementing circular buffers.
2. Managing tasks in round-robin schedulers.
3. Multiplayer gaming for managing turn-based actions.
