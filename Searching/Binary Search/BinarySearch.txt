Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity
Criteria	Complexity	Description
Best Time Complexity	O(1)	Target found at the middle in the first attempt.
Worst Time Complexity	O(log n)	Requires halving the search space multiple times.
Average Time Complexity	O(log n)	Efficient even for large datasets.
Space Complexity	O(1) or O(log n)	O(1) for iterative; O(log n) for recursive due to stack usage.
