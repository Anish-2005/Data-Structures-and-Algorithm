# Linear Search

Linear Search is a straightforward algorithm that sequentially checks each element of an array until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached. It works on unsorted as well as sorted arrays.

## Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity

| Criteria                     | Complexity | Description                                                |
|------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Best Time Complexity**      | O(1)       | Target found at the first position.                        |
| **Worst Time Complexity**     | O(n)       | Full traversal of the array is required to find the target or confirm its absence. |
| **Average Time Complexity**   | O(n)       | On average, the target is found halfway through the array. |
| **Space Complexity**          | O(1)       | No additional memory is used beyond the input array.      |
