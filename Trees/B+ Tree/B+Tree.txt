A B+ Tree is an advanced version of a B-Tree that provides faster sequential access to data. It is widely used in database systems and file systems for indexing large amounts of data efficiently.

Key Properties of B+ Tree:
1. Order (m): Determines the maximum number of children a node can have.
   - Internal nodes have ⌈m/2⌉ to m children.
   - Leaf nodes have ⌈m/2⌉ - 1 to m - 1 keys.
2. Leaf Node Storage:
   - All keys are stored in the leaf nodes.
   - Internal nodes only store keys for routing.
3. Leaf Node Linked List:
   - Leaf nodes are linked for efficient sequential access.
4. Balanced Tree:
   - All leaf nodes are at the same depth, ensuring balance.
5. Efficient Range Queries:
   - Sequential access via linked leaf nodes allows fast range queries.
6. Search Time Complexity:
   - O(log n) for finding the appropriate leaf node.
7. Insertion/Deletion Time Complexity:
   - O(log n) for locating the leaf and modifying the structure.
8. Traversal Time Complexity:
   - O(n) for in-order traversal.
