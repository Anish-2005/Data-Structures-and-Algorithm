Full Binary Tree Definition:
A Full Binary Tree (also known as a Proper or Strict Binary Tree) is a type of binary tree in which every node has either:
1. Zero children (leaf nodes), or
2. Exactly two children (internal nodes).
No node in a full binary tree has only one child.

Properties of a Full Binary Tree:
1. Number of Nodes:
   - If the height of the tree is h (where the root is at height 0), the total number of nodes n in a full binary tree is:
     n = 2^(h+1) - 1
2. Number of Leaf Nodes:
   - The number of leaf nodes L is:
     L = (n + 1) / 2
3. Number of Internal Nodes:
   - The number of internal nodes I (nodes with two children) is:
     I = L - 1
4. Height:
   - The height h of a full binary tree with n nodes is:
     h = log2(n + 1) - 1
5. Balanced Structure:
   - A full binary tree is not necessarily balanced unless additional constraints are applied (e.g., it is also complete or perfect).


Example of a Full Binary Tree:

   4   5 6   7

- Root node: 1
- Internal nodes: 1, 2, 3
- Leaf nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7



Key Differences Between Full, Complete, and Perfect Binary Trees:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| Type                  | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Binary Tree      | Each node has 0 or 2 children.                                |
| Complete Binary Tree  | All levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and the last level is filled from left to right. |
| Perfect Binary Tree   | All internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level. |

Applications of Full Binary Trees:
- Used in binary heaps (when combined with the complete property).
- Foundation for decision trees in algorithms.
- Efficient data storage in prefix codes like Huffman coding.
