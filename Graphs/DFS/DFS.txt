Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure (can be implemented with recursion) to keep track of the vertices to visit.

Key Characteristics of DFS:
Visits all vertices and edges in a graph.
Recursive or iterative implementation.
Explores one branch completely before moving to another.
Used in:
Topological sorting
Detecting cycles
Solving mazes and puzzles
Finding connected components in a graph
