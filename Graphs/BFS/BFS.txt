BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the current depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It uses a **queue** data structure to keep track of the vertices to visit.

Key Characteristics of BFS:
1. Visits all vertices and edges layer by layer.
2. Uses a queue for iterative implementation.
3. Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
4. Used in:
   - Shortest path algorithms
   - Level-order traversal of trees
   - Solving maze problems
