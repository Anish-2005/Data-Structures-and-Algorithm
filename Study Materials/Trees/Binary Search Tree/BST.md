# Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Properties:
- **Binary Tree Structure**: Each node has at most two children (left and right).
- **Order Property**: For any node N, values in the left subtree of N are less than N.val, and values in the right subtree are greater than N.val.
- **Inorder Traversal**: Produces a sorted sequence of values.

## Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity

| Operation    | Best Case     | Average Case  | Worst Case   |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Search       | O(log n)      | O(log n)      | O(n)         |
| Insertion    | O(log n)      | O(log n)      | O(n)         |
| Deletion     | O(log n)      | O(log n)      | O(n)         |
| Space Complexity | O(h)        | O(h)          | O(n)         |
