Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity


Criteria	                  Complexity	                    Description


Best Time Complexity	      O(n log n)	                    Sorting is efficient even for pre-sorted data.
Worst Time Complexity	      O(n log n)	                    Always divides the array and merges, regardless of initial order.
Average Time Complexity       O(n log n)	                    The divide-and-conquer approach ensures consistent performance.
Space Complexity	          O(n)	                            Requires additional space for temporary arrays during merging.
