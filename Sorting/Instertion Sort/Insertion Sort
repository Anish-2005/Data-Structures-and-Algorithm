Here’s a concise summary table for the time and space complexity of Insertion Sort:

Criteria	                       Complexity	                  Description

Best Time Complexity	           O(n)	                          Occurs when the array is already sorted. Only n comparisons are performed.
Worst Time Complexity	           O(n²)	                      Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. Each element needs to be compared with all others.
Average Time Complexity	           O(n²)	                      On average, each element is compared with half of the elements in the sorted portion.
Space Complexity	               O(1)	                          In-place algorithm; no additional space is required apart from the
