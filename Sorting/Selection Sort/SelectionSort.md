# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the array into two parts: the sorted portion (which starts empty) and the unsorted portion. In each pass, the smallest element from the unsorted portion is selected and swapped with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
