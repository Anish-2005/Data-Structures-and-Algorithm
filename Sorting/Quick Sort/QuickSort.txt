Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity
Criteria	Complexity	Description
Best Time Complexity	O(n log n)	Pivot divides the array into two equal halves at each step.
Worst Time Complexity	O(nÂ²)	Pivot repeatedly selects the smallest or largest element, resulting in unbalanced partitions.
Average Time Complexity	O(n log n)	Expected with balanced partitions or randomized pivot selection.
Space Complexity	O(log n)	Space used for the recursive stack (best/average case). O(n) in the worst case due to unbalanced calls.
