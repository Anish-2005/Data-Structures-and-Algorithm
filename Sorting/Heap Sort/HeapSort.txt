Summary Table: Time and Space Complexity
Criteria	Complexity	Description
Best Time Complexity	O(n log n)	Efficient even for sorted data due to heap property maintenance.
Worst Time Complexity	O(n log n)	Consistent even with reversed or random data.
Average Time Complexity	O(n log n)	Expected performance due to balanced heap structure.
Space Complexity	O(1)	In-place sorting, requiring no additional space beyond the input array.
